We were rather young and dumb at the time. Looking for ways to keep ourselves from doing homework after school. <br>
I had a big backyard, with plenty of open dirt to dig through. Me and him used to dig under rocks and rocks<br>
to find the best earthworms, and then use them in earthworm races. It got rather intense, with the Thunderdome<br> 
being a shoebox lid filled with dirt. First worm to cross from one side to the other was the winner. What ensued <br>
was lots of screaming, chanting, and overreactions. At that moment it felt like the fate of the world rested on <br>
the backs of those worms. Between the two of us, I can't even remember who's worm won..

<h2 id=head2> Silliness never leaves us </h2>

<div class=b2>

<p>
Back then it was common to just be silly to make each other laugh. We were just kids, and kids can be remarkably <br>
strange and confusing. My purposefully unnamed friend is still a big part of my life, and that silliness lives on. <br>
Adults are seen as more sensible and controlled, but that same childlike nonsense still lives on in our everyday life, <br>
taking many shapes and forms. It could be something stupid you laugh at, or making noises to yourself in the shower because <br>
you are bored. I personally think that sense of absurdity is what makes us human, and I hope it is something we never lose.
